OEEEO is the mascot of Open Engineering at E.ON Digital Technology. OEEEO's pronouns are they/them, they are non-binary. They are a majestic orca with a kind soul. OEEEO can kill sharks, but most of the time they decide to be calm and friendly to everyone. They own the superpower of being 100% transparent, sometimes they even "show up" as that. You'll never know if they are around. That's a little bit spooky? Yes it is, to be honest.
