# OEEEO, the orca leader
Meet OEEEO, the friendly ocean panda, who leads a whole pack of smart, sustainable and highly courageous orcas!

OEEEO goes by the pronouns they/them. They are authentic and vulnerable, but can sink a yacht within minutes. They rely on their friends, as they value dependability and friendship over everything else. 

OEEEO started computer science at the age of 3. After their parents were killed by whalers, OEEEO decided to not go for a single act of revenge, but learn how to turn the world into a better place not only for orcas, but for all critters on the planet. Humans included. They sensed that the problems of the unreasonably complex humankind has led the world into a dead end, if not lifeforms of all kinds find a way out of it, together. OEEEO believes that their contribution to this venture is tech engineering, fighting one evil complexity with another.  

OEEEO loves all ocean critters, but has sympathy for all animals on the planet. They've explored large parts of the world already and sparked change everywhere they went. They now have decades of experience in turning rough places into cozy homes, changing hostile environments to centers of kindness, being an advocate for all, instead of taking position in one belief. And during all that, they use tech to help save the planet. But it's not only on them. It's on us.
